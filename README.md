# LearningJ2EE
This repository contains code examples and learning materials for Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) concepts, focusing on topics such as JDBC, Servlets, and JSP. The purpose of this repository is to provide a practical hands-on approach to understanding and implementing J2EE components.

Contents
The repository is organized into the following sections:

JDBC: Contains code examples for working with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). JDBC is a Java API that allows Java programs to interact with databases, enabling developers to perform tasks such as connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results.

Servlets: Provides code examples for developing web applications using Servlets. Servlets are Java classes that extend the capabilities of servers and respond to client requests. They are the foundation of Java web development and offer a server-side processing approach.

JSP: Includes code examples for JavaServer Pages (JSP). JSP is a technology that allows the creation of dynamic web pages using Java. It combines HTML and Java code, enabling the embedding of Java code snippets within HTML pages.
